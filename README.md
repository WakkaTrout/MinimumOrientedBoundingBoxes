This repository is about exploring the implementations of various minimum and maximum oriented bounding box algorithms.

The goals are to:
1. Describe various algorithms to compute the desired OBB's in a simple and easy to understand way
2. Compare and contrast the various implementations to learn the performance benefits and tradeoff's
3. More rigorously explore the algorithms so that they can be formally verified
